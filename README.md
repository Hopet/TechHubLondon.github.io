This is the GitHub page for Techhub.London, TechHub’s guide to the best of the local area. All of the information on the website is Open Source, and if you have better suggestions, you are welcome to edit the code and add them! 

You can find the source in the [master](https://github.com/techhubdotcom/techhub.london/tree/master) branch, while the live pages are in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/techhubdotcom/techhub.london/tree/gh-pages) branch.

## Getting started


Noticed a typo? Have a great place to add to one of the lists? You are welcome to edit the website

We ask that all additions fit these criteria:

- It will be a helpful addition to other people using the website
- It only contains links to relevant websites or relevant text
- It doesn’t cause the website to break or contain malicious code

Any edits that do not fit the criteria sadly will not be added to the website :( 
TechHub dot London is a benevolent dictatorship - we reserve the right not to add content as we see fit, but we'll usually add any relevant content.


## Editing the website

- Edit the HTML and add your CSS in `styles/main.css`
- Please store any images you use on GitHub, and do not link to external images
- Send us a pull request with your changes!
